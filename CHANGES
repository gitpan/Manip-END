0.08

Recieved an anonymous patch via rt.cpan.org to make get_pkg take an int arg
for index, index is used inside this function, it must have been picking up
a definition from one of the headers or something.

Also, now I require perl 5.000, no idea if it works for versions that old
but 5.008 is too restrictive. Suck it and see.
